# 🩺 MediNote – Medical Transcription App  

A **Flutter-based medical transcription app** built as part of an assignment to design a tool that doctors can trust during patient consultations.  

The app records patient consultations, streams audio to a backend for AI-based transcription, and ensures reliability even in **real-world hospital scenarios**.

## 📌 The Assignment  

Doctors need an app that can:  

- 🎙️ **Record audio** of consultations.  
- ☁️ **Stream recordings to a backend** for real-time AI transcription.  
- ⚡ **Work seamlessly under tough conditions**, including:  
  - Phone calls interrupting mid-recording  
  - Switching apps to check drug databases  
  - Hospital WiFi dropping out  
  - Sudden battery shutdowns at ~60%  

The challenge: *make transcription reliable, resilient, and trustworthy for real-world medical use*.

## ⚙️ Features  

✅ **Secure Login & Authentication** (AuthBloc + AuthService)  
✅ **Patient Management** (PatientBloc, Patient Models, and Services)  
✅ **Real-Time Transcription Streaming**  
✅ **Resilient Audio Recording** (handles interruptions gracefully)  
✅ **Transcript Storage & Retrieval** (StorageService + BackgroundService)  
✅ **Cross-Platform Support** (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 🚀 Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
- **State Management:** BLoC  
- **Backend:** AI transcription service (streaming audio)  
- **Storage:** Local + Remote (via services)  
- **Platforms:** Android, iOS, Web, Desktop  

---

## 📖 How It Works  

1. Doctor logs in securely.  
2. Starts a consultation → app begins audio recording.  
3. Audio is streamed to the backend for transcription.  
4. If interrupted (call, WiFi drop, app switch):  
   - Recording **auto-resumes**  
   - Unsynced data is **buffered and retried**  
5. Transcripts are stored and can be accessed later.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes  

- **Resilience-first design** – interruptions are expected, not exceptions.  
- **Separation of concerns** – business logic in `blocs`, services handle core functions, and UI pages remain clean.  
- **Scalable structure** – easy to extend with new features (e.g., doctor profiles, prescription notes).

## 📌 Future Improvements  

- 🔒 End-to-end encryption for patient confidentiality  
- 🌐 Multi-language transcription support  
- 🤝 Collaboration features for doctors & staff  
- 🧠 AI-powered summary & keyword extraction

## 👨‍⚕️ Conclusion  

This project demonstrates how **robust Flutter apps** can be designed for **critical real-world use cases** like healthcare. MediNote ensures that **no consultation data is ever lost**—even in messy, unpredictable conditions.
